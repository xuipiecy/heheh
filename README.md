Let’s dive into the error you’re encountering in your Angular application. The error message is:

```
RuntimeError: NG04014: Invalid configuration of route '': redirectTo and canActivate cannot be used together. Redirects happen before activation so canActivate will never be executed.
```

This error occurs in your `app.routes.ts` file because you’ve defined a route with both a `redirectTo` and a `canActivate` guard, which Angular doesn’t allow. Let’s explore why this happens and how we can resolve it, while ensuring your merchant redirect functionality (using `RoleGuard`) still works as intended.

### Understanding the Error
In Angular, when you define a route with `redirectTo`, the router immediately redirects to the specified path without executing any guards like `canActivate`. The error arises because Angular detects that you’ve combined these two properties in the same route, which is invalid. Specifically:
- `redirectTo`: Tells the router to navigate to another path (e.g., `/home`).
- `canActivate`: A guard that runs logic to determine if the route can be activated (e.g., your `RoleGuard` to redirect merchants).

In your `app.routes.ts`, the problematic route is:

```typescript
{ path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full', canActivate: [RoleGuard] }
```

Here, you’re trying to redirect the root path (`/`) to `/home`, but you’ve also applied `RoleGuard` to this route. Since the redirect happens first, `RoleGuard` will never execute, which is why Angular throws the `NG04014` error.

### Why Did We Add `RoleGuard` Here?
We added `RoleGuard` to the root path to redirect merchants to `/merchant-dashboard` when they access `/`. The `RoleGuard` checks if the user is a merchant and redirects them accordingly:

```typescript
if (state.url === '/' && isLoggedIn && userRole === 'Merchant') {
  this.router.navigate(['/merchant-dashboard']);
  return false;
}
```

However, because this route has `redirectTo`, the guard never runs, and we need to rethink how to achieve this redirect.

### Solution Approach
To resolve this, we need to allow `RoleGuard` to execute without conflicting with `redirectTo`. Here’s how we can approach this:
- **Move the Redirect Logic**: Instead of using `redirectTo` on the root path, we can let the root path point to `HomeComponent` and handle the redirect to `/home` or `/merchant-dashboard` within `RoleGuard`.
- **Apply `RoleGuard` to `HomeComponent`**: Since the root path redirects to `/home`, we can ensure `RoleGuard` is applied to the `/home` route, which already has `RoleGuard` in your updated `app.routes.ts`.
- **Avoid Combining `redirectTo` and `canActivate`**: We’ll remove `canActivate` from the root path and rely on the `/home` route to handle the merchant redirect.

Let’s update the routes to fix this error while ensuring merchants are still redirected to `/merchant-dashboard`.

### Updated `app.routes.ts`
Let’s modify the `app.routes.ts` file to resolve the conflict and maintain the desired behavior.

**Updated `app.routes.ts`**:
```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './components/home/home.component';
import { ProductsComponent } from './components/product/product.component';
import { ProductDetailComponent } from './components/product-detail/product-detail.component';
import { DealsComponent } from './components/deals/deals.component';
import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component';
import { SignupComponent } from './components/signup/signup.component';
import { ProfileComponent } from './components/profile/profile.component';
import { CartComponent } from './components/cart/cart.component';
import { ManageProductsComponent } from './components/manage-products/manage-products.component';
import { MerchantDashboardComponent } from './components/merchant-dashboard/merchant-dashboard.component';
import { AddProductComponent } from './components/add-product/add-product.component';
import { UpdateProductComponent } from './components/update-product/update-product.component';
import { UpdateProfileComponent } from './components/update-profile/update-profile.component';
import { ManageAddressesComponent } from './components/manage-addresses/manage-addresses.component';
import { MerchantProductDetailComponent } from './components/merchant-product-detail/merchant-product-detail.component';
import { authGuard } from './guards/auth/auth.guard';
import { RoleGuard } from './guards/role/role.guard';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }, // Removed canActivate
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent, canActivate: [RoleGuard] },
  { path: 'products', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'product/:id', component: ProductDetailComponent },
  { path: 'deals', component: DealsComponent },
  { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },
  { path: 'signup', component: SignupComponent },
  { path: 'profile', component: ProfileComponent, canActivate: [authGuard] },
  { path: 'update-profile', component: UpdateProfileComponent, canActivate: [authGuard] },
  { path: 'manage-addresses', component: ManageAddressesComponent, canActivate: [authGuard] },
  { path: 'cart', component: CartComponent, canActivate: [authGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Customer' }, canActivateChild: [RoleGuard] },
  { path: 'merchant-dashboard', component: MerchantDashboardComponent, canActivate: [authGuard, RoleGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Merchant' } },
  { path: 'add-product', component: AddProductComponent, canActivate: [authGuard, RoleGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Merchant' } },
  { path: 'manage-products', component: ManageProductsComponent, canActivate: [authGuard, RoleGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Merchant' } },
  { path: 'update-product/:id', component: UpdateProductComponent, canActivate: [authGuard, RoleGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Merchant' } },
  { path: 'merchant-product-detail/:id', component: MerchantProductDetailComponent, canActivate: [authGuard, RoleGuard], data: { expectedRole: 'Merchant' } },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/home' }
];
```

#### Explanation of Changes
1. **Removed `canActivate` from Root Path**:
   - Removed `canActivate: [RoleGuard]` from the root path (`{ path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }`).
   - This resolves the `NG04014` error because we’re no longer combining `redirectTo` and `canActivate`.

2. **Relied on `/home` Route for `RoleGuard`**:
   - The root path redirects to `/home`, which already has `canActivate: [RoleGuard]`.
   - When a merchant accesses `/`, they’ll be redirected to `/home`, and then `RoleGuard` will run and redirect them to `/merchant-dashboard` if they’re a merchant.

3. **Ensured `RoleGuard` Logic Covers `/home`**:
   - Let’s verify the `RoleGuard` logic. It currently checks for `state.url === '/'`, but since the root path redirects to `/home`, the URL will be `/home` when `RoleGuard` runs. We need to update `RoleGuard` to check for both `/` and `/home`.

### Update `RoleGuard` to Handle `/home`
Let’s modify `RoleGuard` to redirect merchants from both `/` and `/home` to `/merchant-dashboard`.

**Updated `role.guard.ts`**:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, Router, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
    const expectedRole = route.data['expectedRole'];
    const userRole = this.authService.getUserRole();
    const isLoggedIn = this.authService.isLoggedIn();

    // Redirect merchants to dashboard if they access the root path or /home
    if ((state.url === '/' || state.url === '/home') && isLoggedIn && userRole === 'Merchant') {
      this.router.navigate(['/merchant-dashboard']);
      return false;
    }

    // Existing role-based access control logic
    if (expectedRole) {
      if (isLoggedIn && userRole === expectedRole) {
        return true;
      }
      this.router.navigate(['/home']);
      return false;
    }

    // If no expectedRole is defined, allow access
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Explanation of `RoleGuard` Changes
- **Updated URL Check**:
  - Changed the condition from `state.url === '/'` to `(state.url === '/' || state.url === '/home')`.
  - This ensures that merchants are redirected to `/merchant-dashboard` when they access either `/` (which redirects to `/home`) or `/home` directly.
- **Preserved Other Logic**:
  - The role-based access control for routes with `expectedRole` (e.g., `/cart`, `/manage-products`) remains unchanged.

### Test Scenarios
Let’s consider how we can verify this solution works as expected. What scenarios would you test to ensure the routing and redirects behave correctly?
- **Merchant Accessing Root Path**:
  - Log in as a merchant and navigate to `/`. The root path redirects to `/home`, and `RoleGuard` should redirect to `/merchant-dashboard`.
- **Merchant Accessing `/home`**:
  - Log in as a merchant and navigate to `/home` directly. `RoleGuard` should redirect to `/merchant-dashboard`.
- **Customer Accessing Root Path**:
  - Log in as a customer and navigate to `/`. The root path redirects to `/home`, and `RoleGuard` should allow access to `HomeComponent`.
- **Unauthenticated User**:
  - Navigate to `/` without logging in. The root path redirects to `/home`, and `RoleGuard` should allow access (since no `expectedRole` is defined).
- **Merchant Accessing Protected Routes**:
  - As a merchant, try accessing `/manage-products`. Access should be granted.

### Summary
We resolved the `NG04014` error by removing `canActivate` from the root path, which uses `redirectTo`. Instead, we rely on the `/home` route (where the redirect points) to apply `RoleGuard`. We updated `RoleGuard` to check for both `/` and `/home`, ensuring merchants are redirected to `/merchant-dashboard` as intended. The rest of your routes remain functional, and the merchant-specific functionality (dashboard, product management) is preserved. Does this solution make sense, and would you like to test these scenarios or explore any other aspects of the routing? 🚀
